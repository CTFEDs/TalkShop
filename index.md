# TalkShop

Talks are a great way to get information, but workshop are better suited to learning stuff. We'd like to try and help make the CTFEDs talks more workshop-like so that our members can learn more things.

These ideas are from [Sharon Bowman](http://bowperson.com/)'s excellent book [Training From The Back Of The Room](http://www.amazon.com/Training-From-Back-Room-Aside/dp/0787996629), which is all about putting the needs of the learner first in training sessions.

Our aim is to provide a light template, with some guidelines, that you can use to make your presentation more interactive, and help your audience learn more. It's difficult to make lots of changes at once, so just try and make one change first and see how that goes. The changes below are in our suggested order: they become more interactive (and more work!) as you go down the list.

## Tips for your presentation

* The **last slide in your deck should be your contact details**. After your talk, people might want to get in touch. It's also a good idea to have the same slide at the beginning to introduce yourself.
* **Have an agenda / table of contents** for your talk at the start and at the finish. Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them. This helps the audience remember what you said.
* **Have lots of images**. People remember information presented in images for longer than that presented in text.
* If you ask the audience any questions, or give them any instructions, **have those up on a slide**, and only have one question or instruction up at a time.
 * Have **a clear learning outcome** and present it early in the talk. "After this presentation you will know about X."
 * **Make your audience feel something** (happy? surprised?). Having an emotional response to a piece of information moves in into your long term memory.

## Audience participation

Make your talk **more interactive by asking the audience questions** throughout it. Ask a question, and say that you want three different answers before moving on. The question could be opinion-based, but try and keep the answers short. Or you could take a survey by asking for a show of hands.

## Take a break

Have a break halfway though your presentation. **People concentrate better in shorter bursts than longer bursts**, so your audience will pay more attention. The break should should be something for the audience to do, ideally involving moving around. Be clear about the length of the break, and keep it short: about 5 minutes often works well.

Here are some ideas for break activities. Just do one!

1. Do a survey of the audience on something related to the topic. Ask for a show of hands.
1. Ask some questions of the audience. The questions could be about the material you've covered so far.
2. Have an activity where the audience needs to write some things down. One way to do this is to have lots of sticky notes and pens (we can supply for you!) and ask people to write down something about the material so far. This could be a one sentence summary of the talk so far, or one thing they've learned so far.
3. Ask people to pair up and share one thing they've learned so far.

## While you wait

Start with an activity so that **people have something to do while they wait for everyone else to arrive**. The activity should be related to the topic of your talk.

Here are some examples.

1. Write down one thing you already known about the topic, and share it with someone else in the room.
2. Have a first slide up (as people arrive) with a question for people to discuss. You can start the talk by asking people to shout out their answers to that question.
3. Introduce yourself to someone new and tell them why you're here.
4. Introduce yourself to someone new and tell them one thing you already know about the topic.

## Warm them up

Get **people thinking about your talk** by including a question in the blurb for the talk. Start your talk by asking people their answers to the question.

## End on a high note

Help people connect back to the start of the talk, or help them leave with a clear idea for applying what they learned.

Ask people to write themselves a SMART goal, based on what they learned. A further step is to ask them share this goal: either with a partner they pick, or on the meetup group.
